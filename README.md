## How we built it
The backend was built using Django. The meeting service was built using the Twilio API. The conversation analytics service was built using Symbl.ai

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a lot of challenges:
1. Integrating React with Django in such a way that Django serves as the backend and react as the frontend.
2. Using AWS S3 buckets to store the media files and getting back a publicly accessible URL.
3. Working with Twilio video API ,generating tokens,  integrating it with our Django backend.
4. Working with Symbl.ai, generating tokens, fetching and using the data.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. We were able to learn a lot of things.
2. Was able to make something (if not complete, but atleast a part)

## What we learned
1. Integrating React+Django
2. Working with AWS S3 buckets for file storages, boto3, accessing objects.
3. Working with Twilio video API, integrating it with our Django backend server.
4. Working with Symbl.ai, generating tokens, accessing and using its API

## What's next for Connect 
1.  Adding more advanced insights for conversations using Symbl.ai
2. Adding more features to video like chat
3. Improving the UI/UX, Design
4. Adding a section where recruiters can list open positions and applicants can apply for them
